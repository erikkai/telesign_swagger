# TeleSign APIs in OpenAPI 

TeleSign's APIs are now available as OpenAPI 2.0 specifications (formerly known as Swagger Specifications). 
The OpenAPI specification is a way of describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. 

The APIs are separated out into separate files, and they are grouped by TeleSign customer type.

Enterprise customers should use the swgager-enterprise folder. Standard customers should use the swagger-standard folder. 
If you are unsure what customer type you are, here are details for determining that: 

You are a Standard customer if:
* You signed up through portal.telesign.com
* You use endpoints that start with rest-api.telesign.com
* You work with customer support to resolve issues 

You are an Enterprise customer if:
* You spoke with Sales to get your account set up 
* You use endpoints that start with rest-ww.telesign.com
* You were assigned a Technical Account Manager to work with to resolve issues
